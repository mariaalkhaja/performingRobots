November 5th:
Today I found a base for my robot. I drilled in the motors and glued on a piece of wood for the small wheel, 
I am waiting for it to dry and tomorrow I will drill in the wheel. With that, the construction of the base will
be complete.

    Next steps:
        1 - build stem (decide on material: wood/cardboard/lasercutter)
        2 - solder bluefruit into arduino
        3 - connect the motor to  arduino
        4 - program motor movements
        5 - get + attach neopixils to the stem
        6 - connect neopixil to arduino
        7 - program neopixil facial expressons
       
    
I plan to finish steps 1-5 by the end of next week, and possibly start with steps 6 and 7. I want to work to
finish the first robot as early as I can so I can start practicing how the performance will go, possibly add
more features to it, and because I also have to build a second one. I know I will struggle and will need the
professor's help a lot, so I want to encounter the problems that will pop up as early as possible in the 
process now that we're in a more relaxed part of the semester and we have more time.

November 11:
I connected the wires to the motor. I will go checkout the bluefruit tomorrow and solder it onto the motorsheild.

November 12:
I checked out the bluefruit and soldered it onto my motorshield. I programmed the motors to move correspondingly to
the arrows on the controller. 

    Next steps:
        1- Build and attach stem
        2- Get and attach neopixils for face
        3- Connect leaf and servo 
        4- Program neopixils and leaf
