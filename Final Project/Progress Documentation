November 5th:
Today I found a base for my robot. I drilled in the motors and glued on a piece of wood for the small wheel, 
I am waiting for it to dry and tomorrow I will drill in the wheel. With that, the construction of the base will
be complete.

Next steps:
    1 - build stem (decide on material: wood/cardboard/lasercutter)
    2 - solder bluefruit into arduino
    3 - connect the motor wires to the arduino
    4 - get + attach neopixils to the stem
    5 - connect neopixil to arduino
    6 - program neopixil facial expressons
    7 - program motor movements 
    
I plan to finish steps 1-5 by the end of next week, and possibly start with steps 6 and 7. I want to work to
finish the first robot as early as I can so I can start practicing how the performance will go, possibly add
more features to it, and because I also have to build a second one. I know I will struggle and will need the
professor's help a lot, so I want to encounter the problems that will pop up as early as possible in the 
process now that we're in a more relaxed part of the semester and we have more time. 


November 11:
I connected the wires to the motor. I will get checkout the bluefruit tomorrow and solder it into the motorsheild.
