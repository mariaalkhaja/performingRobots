#Showcase Idea

My idea for the showcase is to divide the class into two groups since some are interested having a music performance
and others are interested in having something more like a play or a short story. The two groups can either then work
together to have something like a musical play with a story combining the two ideas, or work separately to create 
a separate performance. If the group for the story is large, 4-6 people, and could not agree on idea then they can 
split into two groups to create two sepeate performances or have two short performances together.
