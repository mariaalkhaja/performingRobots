#Class Presentation

Assignment:
Find something (e.g. an article, book, website, author, video, play, etc.) that somehow 
related to Robotic Performance and prepare a 5 minute presentation to the class. You might 
find this list of references useful as a starting point, or you can find something else.


I am personally interested in AI and the idea of robotic intelligence and their progression.
Technonlgies are evolving rapidly and robots are getting smarter and more human-like everyday. 
I believe that soon enough we will start having that are as smart as humans, and it will be
hard for some to accept that, as we have ingrained in our brains a specific way of how machines
behave and operate. Not all of us will be able to accept that those machines will be able to
feel emotion and have their desires. That will leave only two options for those machines, either
to 'perform' or act like a robot and subside those feelings, or live away from that human either
by destroying itself or escaping. I believe the video below connects my thought and shows the 
pressure put on Proto on how to 'perform' being a robot correctly.
