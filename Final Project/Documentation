## Overall project concept and description
My final project is about a plant which suddenly comes to life after a thunderstorm strikes. 
It gets very excited about being real and moving around. It goes around in circles and moves back and 
forth, and starts singing a song. Then it realizes that living alone is pointless. It bumps into another plants that looks
just like it but more mature. It starts inspecting it, and talking to it. It gets no response 
starts feeling very lonely and sad, and decides it doesn't want to be real anymore. It starts glitching 
then shuts down. The moment it does so, the other plants wakes up and says,“oh my dear son, what happened to
you."

## List of important parts (don’t include wires, resistors, etc.)
  1- Bluefruit BLE SPI Friend for phone control
  2- 2 DC Motors to drive around 
  3- 1 Servo motor for the leaf
  4- Neopixels strip for the face and around the pot
  5- 5V battery pack
  6- 22V lithium battery



# Problems:
  1- The servo stopped working
  I programmed the servos to move at different speeds and different ranges depending on the emotions of the plant.
  However, when I compiled the whole program the servos would not work. The best solution was to just not use the 
  servo.

  3- Inability to work on the weekend 
  I am only on campus Monday through Thursday, but I leave Thursdays right after my class, which gives me only
  three days to work on my project per week. I had to organize my time really well so that I spend those full
  three days working on my robot, and also working on things that I dont need the lab for, such as the script
  and audio at home.
