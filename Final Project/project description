#Final Project Idea

For my final project, I would like to have a plant which suddenly comes to life after a thunderstorm. 
It gets very excited about being real and moving around. It goes around in circles and moves back and 
forth. Time passes and soon the plant gets bored. It finds a mirror and inspects itself. It plays with 
buttons and gets very amused. Soon enough it gets bored again. It bumps into another plants that looks
just like it but bigger in size. It starts inspecting it, roaming around it, and talking to it. When it
gets no respose it tries bumping into it too, but still doesn't get anything. It starts feeling very 
lonely and sad, and decides it doesn't want to be real anymore. It starts glitching then shuts down. 
The moment it does so, the other plants wakes up and says,â€œoh my dear son, what are you doing lying 
on the floor."
