#Final Project Idea

For my final project, I would like to have a plant which suddenly comes to life after a thunderstorm. 
It gets very excited about being real and moving around. It goes around in circles and moves back and 
forth. Time passes and soon the plant gets bored. It finds a mirror and inspects itself. It 

finds a mirror
inspects itself -> plays buttons
gets bored 
finds other object like it
inspects them
tries to talk to them
none reply 
feels very lonely and sad
doesn’t  want to live anymore
slowly starts glitching and dies
the moment it dies the other object wakes up
“oh my dear son, what are you doing lying on the floor” … 


robot:
- motors to move around 
- neopixil face
- LED around body
- servo to move leaf back and forth
